# Obake

Fantom 2023 Hackathon's submission


Obake is a collection of NFTs on Fantom. Those NFT grant holders revenues from dApps such as a coin flip game and a raffle. Everybody with a wallet on Fantom can interact with those dApps, and for every win/successful raffle a small fee is retained from the gains and shared to Obake NFT holders via the staking contract. No snapshot, nor manual distribution needed.
